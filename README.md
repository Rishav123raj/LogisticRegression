# Logistic Regression Project using Absenteeism Dataset
# Overview
This repository contains a logistic regression project that focuses on predicting a binary outcome based on a set of input features. 
Logistic regression is a widely used classification algorithm that is particularly useful for predicting the probability of an event occurring.
# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
data: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the logistic regression model.
src: The source code for the logistic regression model is located in this directory. The main files include:
Absenteeism-Preprocessing.ipynb: This script implements the logistic regression algorithm, including training and testing procedures.
Absenteeism ML Logistic Regression.ipynb: A script for preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks related to the logistic regression project can be found here. 
These notebooks may include data exploration, model training, and evaluation steps.
